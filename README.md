# Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect emotions from facial expressions using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes data augmentation for improved accuracy and supports real-time detection using OpenCV.

## Features
- Deep learning-based emotion classification
- Data augmentation for better model generalization
- Real-time emotion detection using OpenCV
- Optimized with Adam optimizer

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-detection.git
   cd emotion-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the script to train and test the model:
```bash
python emotiondetection.py
```

## Dataset
This project uses the FER2013 dataset, which contains labeled facial expressions for training and evaluation.
